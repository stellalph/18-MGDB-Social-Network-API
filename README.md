## Installation

*   This application requires the installation of node.js from the website, https//wwww.node.org.

*   Node Package Manager (npm) is a software manager and installer which puts the modules in place so that the node project can utilize it, and also, it manages dependency conflicts intelligently and initialized using **npm init**. The package.json will be generated and will contains all the details of the application in which the user have inputted during the npm initialization. 

*  This application will use the following npm packages:-

  
         - npm install express
         - npm install mongoose
         - npm i moment

* Nodemon is installed as development dependency meaning that if our application ever goes in production, this package will not be included. The command to install for in this case is **npm i -D nodemon**. The purpose of this package is to watch for any changes in our files and restart the server instead of us having to do that manually ourselves. The screenshot show the working of the nodemon.
